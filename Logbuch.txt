# Update summary
            
   v1.7 
       'Version number'
            - adjust number to 1.7 (ProjectInformation.js and mod.json), make sure it says "0ad=0.0.25" and not "0ad>=0.0.25" (IMPORTANT)
            - for testing purpose I changed the mod.json file into >=, for release it should just be =
        'Top Panel'
            - added a new objective for rated games to the top panel (BuildLabel.js) as an icon I used the yellow bell (gui/session/setup.xml)

   v1.6.5 (1/Oct/21)
       'Version number'
            - adjust number to 1.6.5 (ProjectInformation.js and mod.json)
        'Stats'
            - Set the tickPeriod to 6, for a nice harmonic blink rate, 10 is too high, 1 would be perfect, but a small tickPeriod kills the performance. 6 seemed to be the best compromise (boongui_basicOverlay.js)
            - Math.floor(number / 10) * 10 to make the ressources numbers change less often, no one cares if u have 134 or 130 wood.
            - team number appears in the team representative's color in the observer view, there is a small bug in the main game (fixed with rP25951). If the team representative gets "defeated", his color will still be used for the dilpomacy color in the observer view, adding DiplomacyColors.js to the mod and fixing it by only including "active" players.
        'Lobby'
            - change the word  "Replay" into "Replays" (ReplayButton.js)
            
   v1.6.4 (23/Sep/21)
       'Version number'
            - adjust number to 1.6.4 (ProjectInformation.js and mod.json)
        'Stats'
            -  Simplification of the function to check if Phase_town or Phase_city are currently being researched (GuiInterface~boongui.js)
            - moved the teamNumber in front of the player name and aligned all the stats up to the Civ column to the left, looks a bit better (boongui_basicOverlay.js)
        'Lobby'
            - added gui/lobby/LobbyPage/ProfilePanel.js to the mod, to chnage the color and add the rank fo the player name, more consitant to display it in color
            - set the correct "PlayerPresence", when interacting with the replay button and the last score button.
            - Added Engine.LobbySetPlayerPresence("playing"); to the ReplayButton.js file and 		Engine.LobbySetPlayerPresence("available"); to the replay_actions.js file.
            - Added 	Engine.LobbySetPlayerPresence("playing"); to the LastSummaryButton.js file and 	
            else if (g_GameData.gui.dialog && Engine.HasXmppClient()) { Engine.LobbySetPlayerPresence("available");
            Engine.PopGuiPage();} to the summary.js file.
            - Adding some icons/role description to the profile panel and also color the name. The icons are stored in gui/lobby/icons/setup.xml and called in ProfilePanel.js, adjusted the position in ProfilePanel.xml. The new icons come from @maroder and are saved under session/icons_forum_ranks. For the "lowest" rank I just took the donkey icon.
            - the ideas for the names of each rank came from https://wildfiregames.com/forum/topic/16098-user-rankstitles-suggestions/
            - Added ProfilePage.js, ProfilePage.xml to keep it in sync with the ProfilePanel from the LobbyPage. Included a list with all the classes.
        'DataCounter'
            - adjusting the OverlayCounterManager.js file again, after @mysticjim reported to not being able to see the gameTime, when FPS is disabled.

            
   v1.6.3 (6/Sep/21)
       'Version number'
            - adjust number to 1.6.3 (ProjectInformation.js and mod.json)
        'Stats Overlay'
            - added two new .png's which are used to display that someone started to phase up (city_phase_started.png, town_phase_started.png), the icons are defined in the session/setup.xml file, since I also keep the boongui_delenda mod I just added the imperial icon to the session/setup.xml file as well. It does no harm in here.
            - in the GuiInterface~boongui.js new items have been added "phaseTownStarted" & "phaseCityStarted"
            - in the boongui_basicOverlay.js the items from the GuiInterface~boongui.js file were added to show that someone is phasing up.
            - a new column has been added for champions ("Cha"), boongui_basicOverlay.js, GuiInterface~boongui.js and PauseOverlay.xml)
            - I found an easier and more practical way to spilt the name/rating from the playername, previously it did not work out with singleplayer containing a number in the second word, now it does.(boongui_basicOverlay.js)
        'Hotkey'
            - Changing the default Hotkey for toggling the stats overlay from "Shift+S" to "Alt+Shift+F",  and adjusting the description in  mainmenu~boongui.js.
            - changed a name of a function in mainmenu~boongui.js, when enabling boongui/autociv simultanously for the first time only the latter mod gets its function called, the problem should now be fixed
            - IMPORTANT: there was a problem using the Autociv CLI feature (ctrl+C+L). The common/global.xml file from @nani contained some stuff which would have forced me to almost copy its entire common folder in my mod. The only thing I did in global.xml is increasing the font size for the dataCounter (FPS, Game Time, ...). I deleted the common/global.xml file and copied the OverlayCounterManager.js into my mod and increased the width/height of the overlay and made the correct adjustment for the font size - "font": "mono-stroke-14".
            It is somewhat inconvenient to simply increase the font size, but it works and I dont need the common/global.xml file anymore.
        'Minimap'
            - The blue color has been adjusted again (Player~boongui.js and tooltips~boongui.js), the GetColor function is slightly brighter than the GetDisplayedColor function. This makes reading the stats overlay easier and keeps the vivid and visual difference between the player colors on the minimap.
        'Lobby'
            - added a new button, which allows you to see the last game u played. I got rid of the maps button. @Nani wrote the code. I added a small line of code, which informs you, your last replay has an incompatible replay because of a mod (LastSummaryButton.js).
            - added a new button for "Replays" (needed function sits in replay_actions.js and is called replay_menu.xml for pointing in the right direction, depending if you are connected or not with the lobby. The ReplayButton.js was created and correctly registerd in LobbyPage.js. For making the button appear at the correct place the LobbyPage.xml is needed.
            - the AutoCiv has the capability to resize the lobby panels, I moved the "MainMenu, Host and Join Button" from LobbyPage.xml to GameList.xml, this allows the AutoCiv feature to work correctly and reposition those buttons accordingly, when resizing.
            - reduced the font size in PlayerList.xml
            - changed the name of the "Last Summary" button in "Last Score".
        'Replay'
            - changed the style of the buttons in the replay screen from StoneButton to ModernButtonRed
            - fixed the correct spacing between the buttons in the replay_menu.xml file 
        'Art/flag'
            - reduced the size of the garrison_flag to 0.75 from my previous size. Well visible and the size is not too intrusive (SixWheeler.xml as skelton file was created with @Stan's skeleton generator - python3 skeleton_generator.py; garrison_flag.dae and garrison_flag_idle.dae
            
   v1.6.2 (27/Aug/21)
       'Version number'
            - adjust number to 1.6.2 (ProjectInformation.js and mod.json)
        'Minimap'
            - added a big red number above the minimap idle worker button, displaying the total number of idle units(totalNumberIdleWorkers, MiniMap.xml) and changed the minimap-idle-highlight.png and minimap-idle.png to the old ones, without the red background.
            - adjusted the blue/cyan & red/pink colors a bit, to make them more visually different from one another (Player~boongui.js and tooltips~boongui.js)
        'Chat'
            - decreased the font size for chat notifications from 14 to 12 (styles.xml) and increased number of chat lines to 6 (session.xml)
        'Lobby'
            - changed the color for status messages into gray (StatusMessageFormat.js), making it more visually visible when someone joins and leaves the lobby, also applying the same effect for the gamesetup chat (StatusMessageFormat.js). Both files have the same name, only different locations.
            - slightly changed the font color for the chat input text and sprite (both in the gamesetup chat and the lobby chat ChatPanel.xml)
            -added ClientReady.js, changed font from sans-bold-13 to sans-stroke-14 and replaced the "*" with "+++/---".
        'Replay'
            - Moving to the replay menu, when quitting a replay via "Quit" (@Schweini fixed it with D3958 - diffID 18470)
        'Top panel'
            - removed TopPanel.js, because I reinstated the civIcon in the top panel, but just made it smaller
        'Stats'
            - updated GuiInterface~boongui.js with "imperial phase" recognition. Not useful for 0ad, but Delenda Est uses it and making the compatible DE version of boongui, I just copied it over. It does no harm.
        
   v1.6.1 (13/Aug/21)
       'Version number'
            - adjust number to 1.6.1 (ProjectInformation.js and mod.json)
        'Stats Overlay'
            - changed the z-value to 50, so it stays behind the chat window (boongui_basicOverlay.xml)
            - I forgot to include             "trainingBlocked": cmpPlayer.IsTrainingBlocked()" into the GuiInterface~boongui.js, it is now fixed and blinks again.
        'Chat window'
            - increased the font size from sans-13 to sans-16 for the ingame chat window (common/styles.xml)
        'Minimap'
            - added a more colorful idle button to make it easier to see  when someone has idle workers.
            - color comes from @maroder (minimap-idle.png, minimap-idle-highlight.png)
        'Top panel'
            - adjusted the layout for the map information when you are observer, instead of center text_aligned it is now slightly moved inwards from the left side and left aligned, originally I want it to be center aligned above the stats overlay, but changes in the screen size messes it up, this solution is easier to maintain.
        'Lobby'
            - Logging into the lobby, issue when autociv and boongui are enabled, renaming "sgMapTypeAndName" into "sgMapName" (GameDetails.js and GameDetails.xml) solves it.
        'Session'
            - added a useless function to the session~boongui.js file, the autociv mod crops the pauseoverlay to 30%, but I use the pauseoverlay to show important informations. I just copied his function into my file and increased the number to 100%. 
            
   v1.6 (12/Aug/21)
       'Version number'
            - adjust number to 1.6 (ProjectInformation.js and mod.json)
            - the original boonGUI mod had the last version number to be 1.5, i have to update it to 1.6

        'StatsOverlay'
            - reduced functionality of the statsoverlay, instead of having 3 diffrent overlay (stats, units and basic) it has been reduced to just one - the "boongui_basicOverlay.js" (reduced number of needed itmes in the GuiInterface~boongui.js file as well)
            - hotkey for hiding the overlay is defined in boongui_basicOverlay.xml and nroc_basicOverlay.js. Also added the hotkey to the default_config.json, so it will automatically be presented when enabling the mod for the first time, also updated the welcome message in mainmenu~boongui.js, to explain what the hotkey does.
            - reduced player name field down to 9 characters
            - deleted nroc_statsOverlay.xml, nroc_statsOverlay.js, nroc_unitsOverlay.xml and nroc_unitsOverlay.js
        'TopPanel'
            - removed the NewbieRush icon (PlayerViewControl.js and PlayerViewControl.xml)

        'Stats Overlay'
            - moved the "#" (Team number) after the "CIV" and before the phaseIcon column
            - changed the loop function from "for (let i = 0; i < list.length; i++)" into "for (let i = list.length-1;i>=0 ;i--)"
            Idea comes from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1340589/are-loops-really-faster-in-reverse
        'Minimap'
            - added a new folder "minimapbuttons", which includes all icons for the minimap and the background_gradient.png, which @maroder send me via the forum
            - For the higlighted version I just used modulate 140,100,100 from imagemagick
            - For the disabled version, I used the macOS app "Preview" and the option "Adjust color", reduced "Saturation" and "Exposure". Happy with the result.
            - reduced the size and thickness of the golden ring around the minimap (MiniMap.xml)
            - split the black background for the minimap and the hover panel below it, into two parts to better set the correct spacing between the hover panel and the actual minimap. The gap between them is now consistent along the line (background_circle.png, background_hover_panel.png)
            - for the golden ring I ran -modulate 110,130,100 to make it a bit brighter and vivid (background_minimap_circle.png)
            - the line around the hover panel was hand drawn in the "Preview" program thickness 2x (3x might be better) (background_hover_panel.png)
            
   v1.2 (26/Jun/21)
        'Version number'
            - adjust number to 1.2 (PlayerViewControl.xml, ProjectInformation.js and mod.json)
        'TopPanel'
            - Added a new Alpha logo (0ad_alpha_logo.png)
            - Added the map name,  mapsize, biome and popMax also one icon for the map (name, size and biome) and one icon for popCap (BuildLabel.js, BuildLabel.xml and setup.xml). Its very easy to do, mostly copy stuff from common/gamedescription.js and pay attention to use the correct variable: g_InitAttributes.
            - slightly increased the newbieRush logo and added one additional space to the player column in the stats overlay (PlayerViewControl.xml)
        'StatsOverlay'
            - Added the icons for the phases, should improve the readability of the stats overlay a bit. The icons are called from the session/setup.xml file and are implented in nroc_basicOverlay.js. Important: GAIA should not have an icon displayed.
            - Moved some more stats to the base overlay as they both share the same thing, this reduces repetition a bit (nroc_basicOverlay.js, nroc_statsOverlay.js, nroc_unitsOverlay.js)
            - changed the name of the tech colum to "rT"
            - changed the color for the headers from lightgray to a darker tone
            -increased the length of the player column to 13
        'PauseOverlay'
            - The explanation for phases has been removed, with the new icons it is self-explanatory or you have to be a donkey not to understand it. (PauseOverlay.xml)
        'Lobby'
            - Layout was a bit adjusted to my liking, mostly position/ color changes and larger fonts: (ProfilePanel.xml, PlayerList.xml, LobbyPage.xml, GameList.xml, GameListFilters.xml, GameDetails.xml, GameDetails.js and PlayerList.js).
            - added some new buttons (LobbyPage.js, LobbyPage.xml and the buttons: ForumButton, HotkeyButton, MapBrowserButton, OptionsButton and CivilizationLobbyButton)
            - changed the layout of the chatinput, made it red and larger font size (gamesetup/Pages/GameSetupPage/Panels/Chat/ChatPanel.xml, lobby/LobbyPage/Chat/ChatPanel.xml)
            - Lobby also shows the GameTime in the "GameDetails" if an already started game is selected. Easy way to see how long a game has been running. (GameDetails.js)
        'HUD'
            - changed the GUI of the panels in the game window from "0 0 250" to texture="global/modern/background.png" (sprites.xml, MenuButton.xml, PlayerViewControl.xml, overlays)
            - adjusted the shader for chat messages slightly, was not happy about it with 1.1 (item-shading-right.png)
        'MiniMap'
            - Changed the texture and color of the circle (background_circle.png). I used the official 0ad logo and cut out a ring from it. I also adjusted the position of the objects in the MiniMap.xml file to get the desired layout. 
            - Created a new background (background_black.png), adjusted the overall size in session.xml and changed the background color from "0 0 0" to "transparent" in sprites.xml.
            - I had to recreat the icons, i used a circle of the original background.png from the modern folder and put the icons in it. Made a highlight version of each with modulate -130,100,100 plus a ring around it and a disabled version for flare and idle in a gray tone.
        'Projectiles'
            -increased the projectile_stone_med.dae by a factor of 4
        'Fruits'
            - Changed the color, saturation and brightness of palm trees (palm_date_new_3_fruiting.png), bananas (banana.png) and two berry bushes (berry_bush_03.png, berry_bush_04.png). U played around with the imagemagick -modulate formulae till I was happy. Pure intuition.
        'Summary'
            -removed the implemented mod from @dpikt in version 0.9.7, because I never used it (counters.js was deleted again and  summary.js & layout.js were adjusted to the way they were before adding the mod from @dpikt to it).
        
   v1.1 (19/Jun/21)

            - changed the colors in the gamestup as well to be in sync what you see in the game later. The function and colors are stored in common/tooltips~nroc.js and being used PlayerColor.js and ClientChat.js
            - increased the font size for the chatText and chatInput in the lobby and the gamesetup page from sans-13 to sans-stroke-16 (gamesetup/Pages/GameSetupPage/Panels/Chat/ChatPanel.xml, lobby/LobbyPage/Chat/ChatPanel.xml).
            - Increased the username in chat messages from sans-bold-13 to sans-stroke-16 ChatMessageFormatSay.js and ClientChat.js
            -Increased font size in SystemMessageFormat.js and StatusMessageFormat.js
        'Overlay'
            - added new researched tech column "↰↱" (GuiInterface~nroc.js and nroc_basicOverlay.js) and adjusted the size of all overlays, since the new column made the first one a bit wider (nroc_unitsOverlay.js, nroc_statsOverlay.js)
            - moved "Cha" and "Mer" into the 2nd overlay
            - Full circle when cartography has been researched or when there are no more allies. (nroc_statsOverlay.js, nroc_unitsOverlay.js and GuiInterface~nroc.js)
        'MiniMap'
            - adding a tooltip to the stats overlay button (MiniMap.xml)

        --> ART 
        'art/actors/flora/trees'
            - copied over
        'art/actors'
            - Geology and props folder deleted, some maps have these new metal mines, let's see how it goes, we can add it later if needed, we want to make as few changes to the orignal as possible
            - Unit folder also deleted the files in there were fixed for the projectiles in siege catapults, we only need the bigger .dae file now - Very good, that means less files. 
        'art/animation'
            - all copied over
        'art/meshes'
            - all copied over except for the metal mine .dae files (geo_mineral_01.dae and geo_mineral_02.dae) they were deleted since metamines were on some maps updated with A25
        'art/skeletons'
            - all copied over except for the metal mine skelton files (rocks_02_001.xml and rocks_02.xml)

            - deleted - leave out for now, might need to adjust later
        'pregame'
            - Updated MainMenuItems.js
            - mainmenu~nroc.js was changed it no longer needs to restart when the mod is enabled for the first time, hotkeys are still written to the user.cfg file (used the autociv file and made changes to it, to fit my purpose)
        'replaymenu'
            - added the old replay_actions.js file, so that @mysticjim can still play replays via the "Summary" button   
        'session'
            - adjusted PauseOverlay.xml and PauseOverlay.js slightly the "pausedByText" in MP mode sits now between "PauseText" and the description of the stats overlay. Also adjusted the height and width to be fixed in terms of pixel length, rather than being defined as relative numbers. 
            - deleted: files OverlayCounterElapsedTime.js, OverlayCounterRemainingCeasefire.js.DELETED
            - updated: selection_panels.js, styles.xml, sprites.xml, session.xml, GameSpeedControl.xml

            - copied over: session~nroc.js, TopPanel.xml, ResearchProgress.xml, PanelEntities.xml, TopPanel.js, GameSpeedControl.js
            #chat

            #message_box
            - QuitConfirmation.js, QuitConfirmationMenu.js and QuitConfirmationReplay.js were redone according to @schweini's diff from D3958. I removed the question and it now displays only 3 buttons, but the hotkey still works. Also added the NetworkStatusOverlay.js and the messages~nroc.js file and adjusted the session~nroc.js file so that everything works well.
            #minimap
            - updated the files in there, because of the new addition of the map flares button. Personal goal would be to make a round minimap long term, like it better.

            - removed "Sup" and replaced it with "Fem" (GuiInterface~nroc.js, nroc_statsOverlay.js and PauseOverlay.xml)
            - removed "Mil" score, I think too many stats slow down the game, will ask @mysticjim to get rid of some stats e.g. "Cha"
            - "Ele" in the unitsOverlay now includes Archer+War Elephnats (PauseOverlay.xml, GuiInterface~nroc.js). Also accounted the Archer elephants correctly there was a change with the "Pop" and "PRD" column for this unit.
            - added new colums for Mercenaries (Mer) into the stats overlay, they got a boost from A25 lets see if they are used more, otherwise might just throw them in the units overlay (nroc_statsOverlay.js, GuiInterface~nroc.js)
            #selection_panels_middle
            - deleted, seems I started something here and never finished it, so I delete it for now

            - when a player resigns he vanishes from the overlays, if you select him via "Observer dropdown" all his stats are visble  (nroc_basicOverlay.js, nroc_statsOverlay.js, nroc_unitsOverlay.js)
        'PauseOverlay'
            - added the explanations for the "eco", "mil" and "exp" scores  (PauseOverlay.xml)

        'SelectionGroup'
            - increased the size via selection_group_icons.xml
            - the icons for control groups 8 and 9 clashed with the minimap, after adjsuting the z-value it is fixed (selection_group_icons.xml and MiniMap.xml)
        'ResearchProgress'
            - increased the size via ResearchProgress.xml
        'Stats Overlay'
            - added a additional space to the "Kil"  and removed one from the "K/D" column, because the layout is so a bit clearer to read. (nroc_statsOverlay.js)
        'Summary'
            - implemented the "Total Population" on the map mod from here: github.com/dpikt/pop-chart
            - This adds a "On Map" chart (counters.js, summary.js and layout.js)

        'NotificationPanel'
            - with the larger "StatsOverlay" comes a problem, the notifaction in centered in the middle and conflicts with the Overlay, I moved it above the Minimap and increased the font size a bit (TimeNotificationOverlay.xml and styles.xml)
        'MiniMap'
            - applied -modulate 85,100,100  minimap-score.png
            - applied -modulate 80,100,100 to minimap-idle.png, minimap-idle-disabled.png, minimap-diplomacy-on.png and minimap-diplomacy-off.png, changed name of the idle file button and set it correctly in MiniMap.xml
            - applied -modulate 150,100,100 to create highlighte buttons for idle diplomacy on/off minimap-idle-highlight.png, minimap-diplomacy-off-highlight.png and minimap-diplomacy-on-highlight.png
        'Cursors'
            - I changed the metal icon in the top panel and had to change the cursors for gathering metal as well, both come from the Delenda Est mod (action-gather-ore.png and action-return-metal.png)
        'Top Panel'
            - increased font size for the timer (global.xml)
            - adjusted size, color and position of counters (counters.xml and style.xml), since the style for Resources in the Top panel is "resourceText", it is also used for the Barter and trade in the HUD and in the "Bart&Trade" menu, to circumvent it, I just added a new style in styles.xml "resourceTextCounter", which is only used for the top panel resources (Counters.xml)
            - color of pop counter needs also be adjusted in CounterPopulation.js
            - color of the gathers in the resources and pop counter are set to the player color (CounterResource.js and CounterPopulation.js)
            - the Pop counter now also displays the popCap or popMax whatever you want to call it (CounterPopulation.js)
            - added new metal resource icon from Delenda Est mod (metal.png and metal_small.png)
            - removed the "NROC" caption and move the version number below the newbie rush logo (PlayerViewControl.xml)
            - adjusted the logo, made it to fit the version number below it newbie_rush.png
            - adjusted the dropdown font size for GameSpeedControl.xml
            - colored the entire name for "choose player to follow" (PlayerViewControl.js), increased the font size and the length of the dropdown (PlayerViewControl.xml)
            - adjusted GamespeedButton postion (GameSpeedButton.xml)
        'Stats Overlay'
            - adjusted the yellow and red color for max/min number in all three overlays (very minor change, yellow is a bit darker, red looks the same)
            - adjusted the size of the overlay and removed all percentages from "computeSize", now the overlay is visible even in a small 1024x768 window (nroc_basicOverlay.js, nroc_statsOverlay.js and nroc_unitsOverlay.js)
            - added a little color indicator at the end of the columns for nroc_statsOverlay.js and nroc_unitsOverlay.js
            - when a player resigns he vanishes from the overlays, if you select him via "Observer dropdown" the Name, Rating and Civ is present but the rest is replaced with "[Looser]" (nroc_basicOverlay.js)
            - added "trainingBlocked" to the GuiInterface~nroc.js file, blinking was iimplemented for the popLimit number, but the number no longer highlights max/min (see nroc_basicOverlay.js)
            - i moved "PRD" also in the "UnitsOverlay"
        'DevOverlay'
            - increased the font size (styles.xml)
        'Hero Portraits'
            - changed the max number of portraits to 15 from 21 (PanelEntities.xml)
        'Actor'
            - increased the size of the "Garrison Flag" on buildings by a factor of two. Import both files into Blender scale it up and export it. (garrison_flag.dae and garrison_flag_idle.dae)
            - chieck are 50% bigger, the mesh file is chicken.dae and the 8xanimations are in art/animation/quadraped, also the skelton file was Armature.xml added
            - added the projectile_bolt_med.dae file but increased the z-size by two, x and y size by four now all bolt shooters have a larger projectile
            - added weap_arrow_front.dae for larger arrows, increased the mesh via blender by x and y axis and slightly with the z axis. now they are bit longer and thicker
            - added sling_projectile.dae to make Slinger projectiles bigger
            - added weap_javelin_shaft_projectile_a.dae, weap_javelin_shaft_projectile_b.dae and weap_javelin_shaft_projectile_c.dae for larger javelineer projectiles also increased the size by 2x via blender
            -added rock_flaming.xml and changed the mesh file to projectile_stone_med.dae and included the 2x bigger mesh version of projectile_stone_med.dae as well
            - to make the files also show up when running the pyromod command, I have to add the skelton file, with @Stan's GithUb python script it is easy: SixWheeler.xml, Cubo.001.xml, Esfera_001.001.xml, Javelin_stave_projectile_a.xml, Javelin_stave_projectile_b.xml, Javelin_stave_projectile_c.xml, Sphere01.xml and weap_arrow_front_007.xml
            - GOOD TO KNOW, by changing the weap_arrow_front.dae this also changes the size on defense buildings e.g. CivicCenter, Fortress, defense tower and so on.

   v0.9.5 (19/Apr/21)
        'Version number'
            - adjust number to 0.9.5 (PlayerViewControl.xml and mod.json)

            - changed the color in MenuButton.xml, nroc_unitsOverlay.xml, TopPanel.xml, nroc_statsOverlay.xml, nroc_basicOverlay.xml, nroc_unitsOverlay.xml and sprites.xml to a dark black ( 	sprite="color: 0 0 0 250") so the ntire UI has a black background, also changed the minimap art file it is now nicely black colored (minimap_circle_modern.png)
            - adjusted player color from prurple to light purple (Player~nroc.js) 
        'Top Panel'

            - adjusted the gamespeed control so, that it will display on top the stats overlay (GameSpeedControl.xml z=200), this position should be adjusted i a later version correctly, for the moment it is okay)

            - also added a clicking sound to it (MiniMap.xml)
        'Overlay'
            - increased the size of the player name by 2 charachters
            - changed the name of a function, maybe this fixes the hosting problem (need to test it)
            - now there are three overlay; (1) basicOverlay; (2) statsOverlay and (3) unitsOverlay, which can be toggled on/off (see nroc/gui/session/objectives/)
            - added new hotky to flip between statsOverlay and unitsOverlay with "Shift+S" (hotkey was specified in nroc_unitsOverlay.xml and nroc_statsOverlay.xml file and the function to trigger it sits in nroc_statsOverlay.js), also added it to the launch, when starting the mod for the first time (mainmenu~nroc.js and default_config.json)
            - added a new colum for FemaleCitizen, popLimit, Traders, Healers, Ranged and Melee

            - since the adjustmenst for bigger projectiles was made in the actor files, therefore I deleted the stone_projectile_med.xml, stone_ammo_med.xml and tower_artillery_projectile.xml files
            
   v0.9.4 (15/Apr/21)
        'Version number'

        'Player Colors'

        'Chat Notifications'
            - removed all "." and "!" from the messages, I find them unuseful (ChatMessageFormatSimulation.js)
        'Stats Overlay'
            - it sits now nicely in the top left corner after adjusting it in the nrocstatsOverlay.js file, the solution was adjusting "computeSize" in there
            - added new Champions "Cha" column (GuiInterface~nroc.js and nrocstatsOverlay.js)
            - shortended the civ names to 3 characters and all upper case (Mauryas are MRY, everyone else just uses his first 3 letters. (nrocstatsOverlay.js)

            - increased the size of projectiles for Bolt shooters (bolt_projectile_med.xml), some units actors had to be edited, because they used a diffrent file (props/units/weapons/arrow_front.xml) which was also used by archers, to avoid that archers have now huge arrows I changed those files (siege_lithobolos_light.xml, siege_polybolos.xml and siege_scorpio.xml)

        'Chat Notification'
            - Timestamps for players phasing up and completing a phase are completely colored, to better differiante them (ChatMessageFormatSimulation.js)
            - Some Civs (e.g. Spartans) had their specific phase names shown (e.g. Kōmopolis), this has been removed it only shows "Town Phase" now (ChatMessageFormatSimulation.js)
            - Background has been changed to dark (styles.xml)
        'Territory Borders'
            - increasd the thickness from 0.85 to 1 (territorymanager.xml)

            - adjust version. number to 0.9.2 (PlayerViewControl.xml and mod.json)
        'Mainmenu'
            - "Game Lobby", "Replays", "Mod Selection" and "Options" have their own buttons, everything else has been moved to "Rest" and "Single Player".
        'Hotkey'
            - changes to camera.xml and misc.xml have been reverted back, when pressing "Alt+G" it only turned off the "silhouettes" and not the GUI
        'Quit Confirmation'
            - added a 3rd option, when quitting the game "Skip Summary" (QuitConfirmation.js, QuitConfirmationReplay.js and function in session~nroc.js with XmppClient stops when connected via Multiplayer)

            - added description of column titles to the 'PauseOverlay' added some text (PauseOverlay.xml and styles.xml)
        'Hero Portraits'
            - Reduced the size slightly, they were just too big (PanelEntities.xml)
        'Chat Notification'
            - Increased the number of chat lines from 4 to 5 due to the reduced size of the 'Hero Portraits' and thus more space available. (session.xml)
        'Stats Overlay'
            - new "PRD" column which lists all the units that are curerntly produced.
            - The Population column now only includes those actually in the field. No more production units. Added a new column "Support" that lists all "Worker Elephants", "Fishing Boats", "Merchants", "Merchant Ships", "Citizen Women" and "Healers". The "Siege" column is the same but contains all "Warships" and "War Elephants" as well. Removed the "Elephants" column. The "War Elephants" are counted under "Siege", the "Work Elephant" (Mauryas) is counted under "Support" and the "Elephant Archer" (Mauryas) is counted under "Cavalry". The three columns "Support", "Cavalry" and "Infantry" should always add up to the "Population" column at any time during the game, as long as there are no "Siege" units on the field. This is because some "Siege" units are counted 2x or 3x for the "Population" column and always only 1x for the "Siege" column.
            - There is still a problem with the "Hero" count, I wrote detailed description in the GuiInterface file, but will not bother to pursue this issue and just hope nobody notices it. Right now, if your hero is a "Cavalary" and has a melee ability (e.g. swordsman) they are added to the "cav" with +1. Reducing it is possible, but cuases a problem with heros that are "Infantry and e.g "Swordsman" making it -1 for them. Just a stupid problem to solve, nobody cares anyway.
            (GuiInterface~nroc.js and nroc~statsOverlay.js)
            
    v0.9.1 (28/Mar/21)
        'Top Panel'
            - adjust version number to 0.9.1 (PlayerViewControl.xml and mod.json)
        'Stats Overlay'
            - adjusted the pink color slightly from '"b": 0.6' to '"b": 0.8' to make it stand out a bit more against the red color (Player~nroc.js)
            - changed "Kill" to "Kil" and "Deth" to "Dth"
            - included a new cloumn called "Civ"       
        'Hotkey'
            - added a new Hotkey to quickly go to "Quit confirmation" dialog (misc.xml defines the hotkey and  selection_panels_helpers.js includes the function, hotkey string was addded to default.config.json and explained in mainmenu~nroc.js)
            - The files camera.xml and misc.xml have been renamed to camera~nroc.xml and misc~nroc.xml. The reason is to reduce file size and see what I did in those files more easily, in those two cases, I just added a hotkey (explained in wiki/ModdingGuiAndSimulation).
        'Compatibility'
            - Got rid off some erros, from the AutoCiv mod, by renaming functions from 'autociv...' to 'nroc...'
            - You still need to enable the NROC mod after the AutoCiv mod and need to make adjustments in the GUI options panel ('stats overlay', 'player overlay', 'chat panel size change' and 'chat panel font change' need to be disabled) Everything else can be adjusted to your liking and the AutoCiv mod can always be used with the NROC mod.
        'Chat notification'
            - added timestamps for players phasing up and completing a phase (ChatMessageFormatSimulation.js)
            - moved chats a bit up and reduced the number of chats visible to 4, reason is because of control groups intfering and make the timestamps unreadable (session.xml)
        'HUD'
            - changed the sprites.xml to make it black like the 'Top Panel'
        'Options'
            - restored the 3 choices in the "Game Session" tab (options.json)
            
    v0.9 (23/Mar/21)
        'Top Panel'
            - adjust version number to 0.9 (PlayerViewControl.xml and mod.json)
            - move the Gametime and speed multiplier  to the left (global.xml, GameSpeedButton.xml, GameSpeedControl.xml)
            - moved 'Follow Player' button to the right side and remove the text (button is enough) (FollowPlayer.xml)
        'Stats Overlay'
            - changed all colors to be more vivid;
            - @Sayyan (24/Jul/21 Minimap Colours)https://wildfiregames.com/forum/topic/14991-minimap-colours/; 
            - @Dakara (11/May/21 - Dream of gamers) https://wildfiregames.com/forum/topic/26837-dream-of-gamer-16-players-game/?do=findComment&comment=427862;
            - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colors_(compact)

            - K/L ratio added, avoiding 'NaN' value by adding >Number((state.killDeathRatio).toFixed(1)) || 0,< 
            and avoiding 'Infinity' via adding a function and a variable to the statsoverlay.js file 
        'HUD'
            - Slightly larger icons in the center for multiple selections
        'Chat Notification'
            - increased height of chat message lines
        'Hotkey'
            - added a nice Hotkey to access the view of a unit, sky should be seen, if not delete (showsky = "fasle") from your user.cfg file (camera.xml and selection_panels_helpers.js)
            - hotkey folder added nroc_data and and linked to the mainmenu~nroc.js file, will add the hotkey to the user.cfg automatically on Starting up the app
            - Silhouettes are linked to "Alt+G" now
        'Fruits/ Metal'
            - Fruits are more vivid and easier to see
            - Metal mines h ave been implemented, looks better now
        'Options'
            - adjusted the notifications about phase updates from 3 diffrent options to just two (Hide and Show) ChatMessageFormatSimulation.js / options.json

        'Hero Portraits'
            - changed the position because of 'Stats Overlay'
        'Stats Overlay'
            - moved to the left side, but not a workable solution, because it only works for 1920 widths
            - since it is a custom made mod for you, we might try to figure out the best position
        'Chat Notification'
            - moved the chats down a bit, because of the 'Stats Overlay' (session.xml)
        'Top Panel'
            - changed the font for "Follow Player" to "mono-stroke-12"
            - added a new png file logo for "NewbieRush" in the top left corner with name of the mod and version number 0.8
        'Objectives'
            - making the font slightly bigger (ObjectivesDialog.xml)

        'Mod Selection'
            - updated the version number to 0.7.0
        'Top Panel'
            - added a "newbie-rush.png" logo to PlayerViewControl.xml
        'Hotkey'
            - pressing "Alt+G" now also hides the 'Game Time' (OverlayCounterElapsedTime.js)
    
    v0.6 (21/Mar/21)
        'Stats Overlay'
            - changed 'Siege' to 'Sie' and 'Eleph' to 'Ele'
        'Chat Notification'

        'Stats Overlay'
            - added "Eleph" and "Lost"
            
    v0.4 (20/Mar/21)
        'Stats Overlay'
            - deleting the "Tech" column
            
    v0.3 (19/Mar/21)

        'Game Time'
            - changed the font from 'mono-stroke-16' to 'sans-bold-18'
        'Chat Notification'
            - increased the font size from 'sans-bold-stroke-14' to  'sans-bold-20''
    
    v0.2 (19/Mar/21)
        'Stats Overlay' 
            - I changed the position to the top right for the 'Stats Overlay', I tried to dock it like for the minimap, but I am not succeeding so far. It works good for 1920x1200, but if the display size is smaller it reaches into the top panel (I need to figure out how to dock it, like @badosu did)
            - changed 'T' --> '#' ; 'P' --> 'Ω' ; 'Tec --> 'Tech' and 'Kil' --> 'Kill'.
            - Charackter for player names increased to 16 
            - increased text font from 14 to 16
            - changed color to Grey Shader (this is so far
            - the best option to read all 8 names, if you don't like it we can always revert to black)
            - removed that rectangle in the bottom right corner (playersOverlay)
        'Game Time Overlay'
            - I changed the position of the "Game time overlay" to the center in the top panel.

            - The only time that is displayed now is the GameTime (F12)
            
    v0.1 (18/Mar/21)
        'Stats Overlay'
            - added
        'MiniMap'
            - made bigger 

# Miscellaneous
    Installation:
        Download the pyromod file: (Should work on Windows/ Linux and macOS) 
        - Either double click or
        - Drag and drop the file over the 0 A.D. app icon or
        - Right click and the pyromod file and open with the 0 A.D. app 
        Go to 'Settings' --> 'Mod Selection' and enable the mod.
        
    Compatibility, successfully tested for the following mods in A25:
        - none tested so far

        
    Tools
        - 0 A.D. A24b including 'Atlas', CotEditor (text editor), Terminal, ImageMagick
        - Patience, Perseverance and Curiosity
        - Forum threads (e.g. How to modify 0 A.D.?) and trac documentation (e.g. 0 A.D. Mod Layout, 0 A.D. Modding Guide, ModdingResources, ModdingGuiAndSimulation)
         - Using a small existing mod is a good way to start modding the game. 
    
    Why the name boonGUI?
        - Obviously I needed a name and ‘Langbart_visibility' wasn't enough for me, but instead of just making up a word, I definitely wanted to include something so people would automatically know what kind of mod it was, so GUI was in and boon was later found via dictionary.
        
#Future ideas:
        - Eco Idle Time  (see image below), it tells you how much time is wasted by villagers just standing around
        - sorted 'Total Score'  list maybe I could just use the lobby layout (left side) for this, list all the player names and add the score to it.
        - add a spectator icon
        - add a Phase icon in the "TopPanel" and maybe some background color
        - When a player "moves up a phase and completes a phase" make the message clickable, so that you are transported directly to the person's CC.
        - change the "Diplomacy" and "Barter&Trade" panel, make it sexy and big
        - add a crown or some particles to the hero, to make him more visible
        - a play, fast forward and pause button for speed control
        - adjust barter&trade to have 75% at metal and 25% at stone
        - Hover over the "rT" (researched Tech) column should display all researched Techs by player with icon
        - adjust hero portraits location based on how many players or find a better location
        - add the "Replays" button the lobby page
        - make small bushes around the CC more noticeable (@Carid)

        - When you pause the game, you should be able to pause the background music or have hotkey mute button (e.g. I am in the lobby but I want to kill the music quickly, because I want to watch a video in my browser) See D3433.
        - Adding some options to turn off features (gui/options/options.json D2936)
        - Add the ability to see thumbnails in the mod selection overview. Factorio style, see #6053.
        - Add some speed hotkey, to increase speed mulitplier
        - Make changes to the loading screen, bigger and different images, do it like you think it should be (D1730)
        https://wildfiregames.com/forum/topic/25204-improving-the-loading-screen/
        I would like to have different tips, e.g how is the total/ military/ economic score calculated; maybe advice with UDP problem 
        turn off formations via right click
        include GIFS rather than just png files
        - Show biomes in map preview #6017
        - Make Summary screen scalable #5002 
        - add trivia facts & solutions for user problems e.g. udp port (see at zotero) at. the loading page
        - add some useful FAQ advices e.g. right click to disbale formations
        - add a hotkey that brings you home to your CC, Just press "H"
        - change hotkey for 'Main Menu' to "ESC"
        - add avialble housing https://github.com/andy5995/show-available-housing
        - add small rings around the berry bushes, https://wildfiregames.com/forum/topic/37668-option-to-enable-color-markers-for-units/?do=findComment&comment=421802
        - add the timeout idea https://wildfiregames.com/forum/topic/37674-feature-timeout-for-the-duration-of-a-game-20min-30min-40min-50min-60min-70min-80min
        - add wager /deposit points before entering a game in the lobby https://wildfiregames.com/forum/topic/36907-player-dont-want-lose-rating-against-very-low-rated-players-they-cheat
        - make the "Delete" button without conformitaion to kill units
        - I like the idea of "Taunts", send someone "42" and he sees and hears a message e.g "I need wood" or "On my signal, unleash hell" (more taunts can be found here https://wildfiregames.com/forum/topic/1224-in-game-taunts/ and https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Taunts#Community_taunts); some useful software for Audio can be found here https://alternativeto.net/software/forvo/

#Some TO-DO stuff, things that work but could be improved:
(1) The blinking of the pop counter is not in sync with the "Overlay" popLimit, this might be caused by the tick period in the boongui_basicOverlay.js.
(2) The empty circle in the StatsOverlay remains even if you are the last of your team and have not researched the "Cartography" tech, because it counts also the "defeated" mutual allies, which it should not.
(3) The way I filter out "AutoResearchedTechs" from "researchedTechs" should be made better (GuiInterface~boongui.js).
(4) Observer mode now shows the map name and an icon, the icon is the same as the one for the "Objectives" button, make it clickable and only show one of the buttons. 
(5) The hero button position should adopt to the length of the stats overlay.
(6) the phasing up should display the progress, not just a static green icon.
